	Abstract = {The estimation of causal effects from non-experimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. One of the main obstacles concerns confounding by observed or latent covariates, an issue which is typically tackled by adjusting for some set of observed covariates. In this contribution, we analyze the problem of inferring whether a given variable has a causal effect on another and, if it does, inferring an adjustment set of covariates that yields a consistent and unbiased estimator of this effect, based on the (conditional) independence and dependence relationships among the observed variables. We provide two elementary rules that we show to be both sound and complete for this task, and compare the performance of a straightforward application of these rules with standard alternative procedures for selecting adjustment sets.},

@article{WANG2015980,
	Abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

@article{mkks2017,
	Abstract = {{Many in the survey research community have expressed concern at the growing popularity of nonprobability surveys. The absence of random selection prompts justified concerns about self-selection producing biased results and means that traditional, design-based estimation is inappropriate. This paper seeks to provide insight into the conditions under which nonprobability surveys can be expected to provide estimates free of selection bias. In fields such as epidemiology and economics that routinely work with observational data, researchers have identified the necessary conditions for unbiased estimation of causal effects when treatments are not assigned randomly. Similar conditions apply to survey estimates when respondents are not randomly selected. Drawing on this body of research, we propose a framework composed of three elements that determine the level of selection bias in survey estimates. In this paper, we first provide a general overview of these components and demonstrate the link between causal inference and survey inference in the probability-based setting. Second, we give simplified examples to demonstrate how each of the components can contribute to bias in survey estimates. Finally, we review current practices in the area of nonprobability data collection and estimation, and specify how these methods relate to the elements identified here.}},
